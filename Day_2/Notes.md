# Day 2 â€” Class Notes (p5.js)

## Topic 1: Animation Using `sin()` Function
- Learned to create **smooth and natural animations** using the `sin()` function.
- `sin()` generates values between -1 and 1, which can be used to **make objects grow and shrink continuously**.
- Combining `sin()` with frame count allows **dynamic, continuous motion**.
- Practiced making shapes **pulse smoothly**, like a breathing effect or bouncing objects.

## Topic 2: Functions and Code Reusability
- Learned how to create **custom functions** to draw objects, keeping the code cleaner and organized.
- Functions can be **reused multiple times**, reducing repetition.
- Applied functions to draw objects at any position, showing how **modular coding works**.
- Realized that using functions makes it **easier to manage complex sketches**.

## Topic 3: Inbuilt Variables
- Explored important **inbuilt p5.js variables**:
  - `mouseX` and `mouseY` to track mouse position.
  - `width` and `height` for canvas dimensions.
  - `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` to cover the full browser window.
- Learned to **create interactive sketches** by using mouse position and canvas size dynamically.
- Practiced **mirrored interactions**, where objects respond in multiple positions relative to the mouse.

## Key Learnings / Summary
- `sin()` helps in creating **smooth, natural motion** in animations.
- Functions make code **clean, structured, and reusable**.
- Inbuilt variables allow sketches to be **interactive and responsive**.
- Combining animations, functions, and variables enables **creative, dynamic, and engaging visuals**.
- Learned the importance of **planning and structuring sketches** for better results.
