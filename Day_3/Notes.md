# Day 3 â€” Class Notes (p5.js)

## Topic 1: Randomized Prints and Patterns
- Learned to use the `random()` function to generate **random numbers** between 0 and 1.  
- Applied **conditional statements** (`if-else`) to create **different outcomes** based on random values.  
- Practiced drawing **dynamic patterns**, like diagonal lines, that **change every frame**.  
- Explored how to **incrementally position shapes** using variables for `x` and `y` to fill the canvas systematically.  

---

## Topic 2: Conditional Statements and Interaction
- Learned how **conditional statements** can change behavior based on **mouse position**.  
- Practiced creating interactive sketches where shapes **change type** (circle or rectangle) depending on mouse location.  
- Explored changing **colors dynamically** based on conditions, making the sketch **more responsive and engaging**.  
- Understood how to combine **user interaction** with **custom functions** for repeated drawing tasks, like drawing a flower at the mouse click.

## Topic 3: Functions for Reusable Design
- Practiced creating **custom functions** to handle repetitive drawing tasks.  
- Functions help to **organize code**, making sketches modular and easier to modify.  
- Learned to pass **parameters** to functions (position, size) to create **dynamic and reusable designs**.  
- Explored randomness inside functions to generate **varied outputs** every time the function is called.  

---

## Topic 4: Loops (`for` Loops) and Pattern Generation
- Learned to use **nested `for` loops** to fill the canvas with repeated patterns.  
- Loops allow creating **grids of shapes** efficiently without writing repetitive code.  
- Combined loops with **randomization and conditionals** to create **unique, generative designs**.  
- Practiced triggering loops using **mouse events**, making patterns **interactive and dynamic**.  

---

## Key Learnings / Summary
- Random numbers + conditionals = **dynamic and unpredictable designs**.  
- Functions improve **code organization, reusability, and flexibility**.  
- Loops enable **efficient repetition** and help in generating **complex patterns**.  
- Combining **randomness, interaction, functions, and loops** allows the creation of **creative, generative art**.  
- Learned the importance of **structuring code** to manage multiple elements effectively.
