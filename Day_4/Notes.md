# Day 4 â€” Generative Patterns Using Images (p5.js)

## Topic 1: Concept of Generative Patterns
- Generative patterns are designs created **algorithmically**, not manually.  
- Each pattern can be **randomly generated**, making the canvas unique every time.  
- Useful for **art, interactive designs, and creative visuals**.  

---

## Topic 2: Loading Images
- Multiple images can be preloaded to serve as **building blocks for the pattern**.  
- Preloading ensures images are **ready before the sketch starts**.  
- Each image represents a **possible pattern tile** to be drawn on the canvas.  

---

## Topic 3: Grid-based Placement
- The canvas is divided into a **grid using a defined rectangle size**.  
- Nested loops iterate over **rows and columns** to place images systematically.  
- This method allows **organized placement** while keeping randomness in content.  

---

## Topic 4: Random Selection of Images
- Random numbers are used to **select which image to place** in each grid cell.  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`) determine **which image corresponds to each random number**.  
- This ensures **different combinations and unique patterns** every time.  

---

## Topic 5: Interaction
- Mouse events can trigger **new generative patterns** on the canvas.  
- Adds **interactivity**, allowing the user to refresh or change the design dynamically.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Generative patterns combine **randomness, loops, and images** to create dynamic visuals.  
- Grid-based placement keeps the design **structured yet flexible**.  
- Using conditional statements and random selection ensures **variety in output**.  
- Interaction adds a **user-controlled element**, enhancing creativity.  
- Foundation for creating **interactive generative art** in p5.js.
